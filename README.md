# CUP-DNN
CUP-DNN is a deep neural network model used to predict tissues of origin for cancers of unknown of primary. 
The model wad trained on the expression data of 2387 genes from TCGA RNAseq data of 32 tumor types. We would like to use this pretrained model for transfer learning with our clinical data. With the tranfer of pretrained model, we expect that our new model with clinical could predict more tumor types, and partially alleviate the scarcity of clinical data often encountered in clinical studies.
